# Spatial Analysis Tasks

This project demonstrates advanced spatial analysis techniques applied to diverse datasets, including simulations, biological data, and real-world infrastructure data. It covers topics such as intensity estimation, spatial randomness testing, and fitting inhomogeneous Poisson models.

## Objectives
1. **Simulate and visualise spatial processes**: Generate realisations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes and analyze their spatial characteristics.
2. **Analyse biological data**: Investigate spatial patterns in rat gastric mucosa cell data using kernel smoothing and pair correlation functions.
3. **Explore environmental data**: Study trends in New Brunswick forest fire locations, including intensity estimation and spatial randomness tests.
4. **Infrastructure analysis**: Examine the spatial distribution of Melbourne public toilets, estimate intensities, and simulate point processes to explore spatial patterns.

## Key Files
- `Spatial Analysis tasks in R.pdf`: The report documenting the analysis and results for each spatial dataset, including the R code used.
  
## Techniques and Tools
- **Kernel Density Estimation**: For visualising intensity variations across space.
- **Spatial Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests**: To assess spatial randomness of point patterns.
- **Poisson Process Modeling**: Fit inhomogeneous Poisson models to real-world datasets.
- **Visualisation**: Generate informative plots for spatial trends and intensities.

## Prerequisites
- R (v4.3.3 or later)
- RStudio (v2023.12.1-402 or later)
- R packages: `spatstat`, `stpp`

## How to Use
